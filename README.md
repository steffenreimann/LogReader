# Satisfctory Log Reader

### The log reader calls the log file automatically and attaches itself back to it when it is recreated.

### That means you can run the log reader permanently between several satisfactory sessions. 

### In addition everything that does not come from the Satisfactory Mod Loder is filtered out! 
#### (should be customizable in the future)
### Via the webclient you can also download the file and display it in raw format or copy the path to the clipboard.
